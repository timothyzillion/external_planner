This is an experiment.

Originally started with Postgres 9.0, now using Postgres-9.1.1.

The goal is to emit the postgres query-tree (parse tree) in a format
that is useful to external programs, and to send the serialized
query-tree out to an external program. The external program can send
back an ERROR (which makes us plan as normal), or a serialized plan
in which case we avoid the native Postgres planner and execute the
provided plan.

There are some security issues with writing things this way (a bad
planner could send back plans which are valid but do harm).

Essentially this is a framework for playing with query-planning;
especially for playing with query-planning. Query-planning in other
languages, or with non-postgres representations.
